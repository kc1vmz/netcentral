This document attempts to describe all of the steps and nuances of deploying Net Central onto different operating systems.
It is best to get Net Central running against an APRS-IS server then add radio support.  This is to prove that Net Central is working pefore introducing the nuances of each radio.


Overview

The following steps are expected for all operating systems:
  Install Java 21 JDK
  Install MySQL (preferrably 8)
  Initialize MySQL for Net Central
  Install Maven
  Get Net Central source code
  Install VS Code (optional)
  Configure Net Central environment variables
  Build Net Central
  Pre-run configuration steps
  Run Net Central
  Configure Net Central
  Conclusion


Install Java 21 JDK

The Java 21 JDK can be downloaded from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21
Be sure that JAVA_HOME is properly set to allow Maven and Net Central to work later in this process.

The easiest way to install Java 21 on Linux is to run the following command:   sudo apt install default-jdk -y


Install MySQL

MySQL can be downloaded from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
I have only tested with MySQL 8.

The easiest way to install MySQL on Linux is to run the following command: sudo apt install mariadb-server


Initialize MySQL

Once MySQL is installed, you need to create the schema/database and the Net Central user to access it.

The following SQL can be executed against the MySQL server:

  create schema netcentral;
  create user 'netcentral'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'netcentral';
  grant all privileges on netcentral.* to 'netcentral'@'localhost';
  flush privileges;


Install Maven

Maven is a build tool used to build the Java components of Net Central.

To download and install Maven, see https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
On Linux, the easiest way is to run :
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install maven -y
On Windows, download from the above link and install.


Get Net Central source code

Net Central source code is available on Github at https://github.com/kc1vmz/netcentral

To download the source code, select the options from the green Code button.

To download a git client, see https://git-scm.com/ and follow the instructions for download and install.
The easiest way to to this on Linux is to run "sudo apt-get install git"

Quick notes on SSH downloads - to configure SSH downloads, perform the following commands to configure:
  git config --global user.name "your_git_username"
  git config --global user.email "your_email_address"
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email_address"
Then copy the public key to Github via the "SSH and GPG keys" page on your account settings.


Install VS Code (optional)

If you choose to build and run in VS Code, you can download and install VS Code at https://code.visualstudio.com/download

The easiest way to download and install VS Code on Linux is to run the command: sudo apt install code
Run "code" from a terminal to start VS Code.


Configure Net Central environment variables

At a minimum, the following environment variables need to be set:

  NETCENTRAL_APRS_CALLSIGN=YourCallsign
  NETCENTRAL_TRANS_APRSIS_PASSCODE=YourAPRSISpasscode
  NETCENTRAL_TRANS_APRSIS_CALLSIGN=YourCallsign
  NETCENTRAL_SERVER_TEMP_DIR=TempLocationForLogsAndReports

The following values should be used in future steps for initializing Net Central:
  NETCENTRAL_SERVER_USERNAME=serviceAccountName
  NETCENTRAL_SERVER_PASSWORD=serviceAccountPassword

  NETCENTRAL_TRANS_APRSIS_QUERY=r/42.222/-71.57/500
  This can represent an APRS-IS server query for your location. See https://www.aprs-is.net/javAPRSFilter.aspx for more details.

Make sure that you create the following directories based on your value of TempLocationForLogsAndReports above
  mkdir %NETCENTRAL_SERVER_TEMP_DIR%
  mkdir %NETCENTRAL_SERVER_TEMP_DIR%\logs
  mkdir %NETCENTRAL_SERVER_TEMP_DIR%\reports

On Linux, make sure to set the owner to someone other than root: 
  example: sudo chown USERNAME %NETCENTRAL_SERVER_TEMP_DIR%


Each additional transceiver (KISS, Kenwood, others) have their own environment variables as well.  See the end of this document for all variables.

For Windows, use the Advanced options to set system-wide environment variables so all apps (Command Prompt, VS Code, etc) can see them.
For Linux, add the variables into the /etc/environment file or equivalent for your Linux distribution.


Build Net Central

To build Net Central using Maven, change directory to where you downloaded the Net Central source code and run "mvn clean install".
To build Net Central using VS Code, open the folder where Net Central source code was downloaded. It will automatically build all of the components.


Pre-run configuration steps

Before running Net Central, there are a few operating system nuances you must be aware of and perform actions to mitigate.

Linux does not like port numbers in use below 1024 by non-root users, so the following steps must be performed to allow the UI to run properly: 
  sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin
  readlink -f `which node`     (gives you NODE_PATH)
  sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep NODE_PATH

You must open ports 8880 and 80 on server firewall to allow API and UI to work properly.

Optional - If you choose to make you Net Central UI available on a public IP address (beyond your local LAN), update .ui/net-central/.env file with public IP address in VITE_APP_API_URL


Run Net Central Server and UI

To run Net Central server from a command prompt / terminal, do the following:
  From the Net Central source code directory, change directory to ./netcentral-server/target
  Run "ls netcentral-server*.jar" or  "dir netcentral-server*.jar" to find the jar filename
  Run "java -jar filename.jar" using the file name (with version) from last step

To run Net Central APRS-IS transceiver from a command prompt / terminal, do the following:
  From the Net Central source code directory, change directory to ./transceivers/transceiver-aprsis/target
  Run  "ls transceiver*.jar" or "dir transceiver*.jar" to find the jar filename
  Run "java -jar filename.jar" using the file name (with version) from last step
  You will see log errors until you complete the configuration below.

To run Net Central UI from a command prompt / terminal on Linux, do the following:
  From the Net Central source code directory, change directory to ./ui/net-central-ui
  Run "npm run dev" to start the UI.
  If the UI does not start, you may need to install Node.JS
    nvm install --lts
    npm install

To run Net Central UI from a command prompt / terminal on Windows, do the following:
  Do all steps from a Linux subsystem such as Ubuntu or Debian
  From the Net Central source code directory, change directory to ./ui/net-central-ui
  Run "npm run dev" to start the UI.
  If the UI does not start, you may need to install Node.JS
    nvm install --lts
    npm install


Configure Net Central

Once Net Central is running you must complete the configuration to allow the software to function correctly.

Use a web browser to connect to app - http:\\localhost
You must register the owner user - see Register menu to left.  This user will be the system administrator unless others are promoted later.
You must register a service account - see the same Register menu to left, use service account username and password from environment variables above.  This allows the transceivers to talk to the server.
Once the two users are registered, log in as the owner user - see Login menu to left
Promote the service account - see Setup menu, select service account, Setup/Users - promote service account 
Enable the APRS-IS transceiver to send and receive data - see Setup menu - select APRS-IS transceiver, select Actions pane, press Enable Receive and confirm. Repeat for Transmit.


Adding radio support via KISS

Once you have proven that Net Central is working, you can add radio support.

Before starting, you can either stop the APRS-IS transceiver process, or leave it running and disable receive and transmit capabilities via the Setup menu.
You can optionally delete all of the previously heard APRS data using the Tools menu.

If using KISS via serial port, know the com port being used.
If using KISS via Bluetooth, pair the radio with the server and assign it a com port to be used.

Update the following environment variables
  NETCENTRAL_TRANS_KISS_TNC_BAUD=1200
  NETCENTRAL_TRANS_KISS_TNC_PORT=COM4

Ensure the port and baud rate values match what you are using.

To run Net Central KISS transceiver from a command prompt / terminal, do the following:
  From the Net Central source code directory, change directory to ./transceivers/transceiver-kiss/target
  Run  "ls transceiver*.jar" or "dir transceiver*.jar" to find the jar filename
  Run "java -jar filename.jar" using the file name (with version) from last step

Enable transceiver to send and receive - see Setup menu - select KISS transceiver, select Actions pane, press Enable Receive and confirm. Repeat for Transmit.



Conclusion

Net Central should now be up and running!

Verify that you are seeing new APRS objects using the Dashboard or Explorer pages in the UI.
