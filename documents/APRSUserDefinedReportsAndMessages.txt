Introduction

Net Central will manage a set of "priority" objects that have data specific to its type.
While objects will broadcast themselves as APRS objects through position packets, they can maintain significantly more information that can be queried from Net Central or APRS clients.

Envelope

Output as APRS User Defined packet ({) with object callsign as callsign-from.
    {ZNXXYYdata

    { user-defined packet identifier
    Z user id
    N packet type
    XX object type
    YY report type
    data - report specific packet

    As APRS User Defined packets are not yet routable via APRS-IS, they are useful for communicating between multiple Net Central servers over RF.

Input as APRS Message (:) to object callsign

    : message packet identifier
    XX object type
    YY report type
    data - report specific packet
